# Credit_Card_Default_Prediction
A project made during Auburn Hacks 2021

It consists of 3 models each with around 80% accuracy in detection of credit card defaults.
One feeds in an excel file of customer information with the required features and gets either 'safe' or 'default' values as prediction.
It also visualizes the patterns and correlations between the various features of the dataset
